                What is Petizens? We're glad you asked!
            </h3>
            <p>
                Petizens is an Online Animal Community Based in Malaysia. Petizens allows you to interact with pet owners all around Kuala Lumpur, 
                sharing experiences and multimedia content such as posts and photos about your pets.

                Our Mission
            </h3>
            <p>
            You can find groups, profiles and communities of animal lovers everywhere, on every social network. So why shouldn't pets have their own social 
            network, just for them? Another reason behind this idea is a large number of animals in shelters and on the streets. We want to help those animals.
            Through analyzing and planning we came up with this idea. People love animals, they love to share them and look at them. By creating a network 
            specified for this type of content we are connecting all animal lovers in one place, increasing the potential impact of our message. Which will 
            hopefully inspire those who don't have pets to adopt them and find homes for as many sheltered animals as possible.
